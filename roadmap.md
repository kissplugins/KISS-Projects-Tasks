## 1. Test Key Helper Functions

The plugin has helper functions in `reports.php` that are crucial for formatting data correctly. The current tests don’t check these directly, meaning a change in their logic wouldn’t be caught.
`	•	ptt_get_assignee_name()`: This function translates a saved assignee ID into a display name.
	- **Proposed Test**: We could add a new test that creates a test user and a test post, assigns the user to the post using `update_post_meta`, and then calls `ptt_get_assignee_name()` on the post’s ID. The test would pass if the function returns the correct display name for the user and fails otherwise. It could also test the fallback “No Assignee” text.
`	•	ptt_format_task_notes()`: This function is responsible for sanitizing, truncating, and converting URLs into links in the task notes displayed in reports.
	- **Proposed Test**: A new test could be created to check this function’s logic. It would pass a string containing HTML and a long URL to the function and then verify that the output:
		- Has the HTML stripped.
		- Is truncated to the correct length (200 characters).
		- Contains a correctly formatted `<a>` tag.

## 2. Refine the “Reporting Logic” Test

The current “Reporting Logic” test (Test #5) runs a generic `WP_Query` which is a good start but doesn’t test the complex, custom logic that happens _after_ the query within the `ptt_display_report_results()` function.
- **Test Custom Status Sorting**: A key feature of the reports is the custom sorting based on task status (e.g., “In Progress” before “Completed”).
	- **Proposed Test**: Instead of a broad query, we could make this test specifically check the status sorting logic. It would replicate the steps from the `ptt_display_report_results` function to build the status order map and then verify that the statuses are sorted in the correct, expected order. This would provide a much more meaningful test of the actual reporting feature.
